## Skillet + Oven Method

From [omnivorescookbook](https://omnivorescookbook.com/crispy-chinese-duck-breast/):

1. Pre-heat oven to 425°F (218°C)
2. duck breast skin side down in a cold killet and cook over medium heat.
3. Simmering skin -> turn down heat to medium-low, cook for another **10-12 minutes**
4. Golden brown skin -> pan into oven Keep rendering fat skin-side down for **8 minutes**.
5. Flip the duck breast and continue to bake for 6 to 8 minutes. The duck will reach medium inside, and the skin will crisp up perfectly.
6. Rest the duck without cover, for **10 minutes**.
