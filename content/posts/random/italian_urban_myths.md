## Italian Rules

- When you swim after eating → you will die from a stroke.
- When you swim in a lake → watch out for the maelstrom at the center.
- There's a 100% chance you get a cold when you go outside with wet hair.
- Walking outside below 10C with an unzipped jacket → Instant Colpo d’aria.
- To cure a cold you put Vaporub on your feet.
- Olive oil should not touch plastic lest you end up in hell.
