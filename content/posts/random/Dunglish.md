This is a list of words commonly used by Dutch people,
that mean something entirely different to native speakers.

Warning: contains sweeping generalisations.

### Scooter

##### Americans: 

##### The British:

##### The Dutch:

### After dinner dip

##### Native speaker: 

Sure, I'd love to go swimming after dinner. 
By the way, where is your pool?

##### The Dutch:

Food coma
### Tie-wrap

##### Native Speaker:

Never heard of Thai wraps before, 
but I love me some asian fusion!

##### The Dutch:

Zip-ties, cable-ties. 
Tie-wrap comes from Ty-wrap, 
the original brand name that stuck.

### Beamer

##### Americans: 

I like German cars, 
but why should I hook it up to my laptop?

##### The British: 

Star Wars laser beam thing? Pew pew.
##### The Dutch: 

A projector.
###  Panty's 

pronounce: panties
##### Native Speaker: 

Undergarments.
##### The Dutch:

Dutch panties go on the foot. 
Panty's are shorthand for _pantyhose_.
Like the garment itself, the shorthand was invented during a time when Dutch still spoke Dutch.
